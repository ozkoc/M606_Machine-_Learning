Introduction

Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the developed world, representing a critical public health challenge. The severe consequences of heart attacks and strokes highlight the urgent need for effective preventive measures to reduce the incidence and impact of these conditions. Early detection of individuals at high risk for heart disease is crucial for enabling timely interventions and improving patient outcomes.

This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart attacks in patients by analyzing a dataset comprising various medical features. The dataset includes the following features:

--Age
--Sex
--Chest Pain Type (cp)
--Resting Blood Pressure (trtbps)
--Serum Cholesterol (chol)
--Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)
--Resting Electrocardiographic Results (restecg)
--Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalachh)
--Exercise Induced Angina (exng)
--ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest (oldpeak)
--Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (slp)
--Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (caa)
--Thalassemia (thall)
--Target Variable Indicating Presence of Heart Disease (output)

By analyzing these features, the machine learning model aims to accurately predict the likelihood of a heart attack in the near future. The results of this predictive model can provide valuable insights to healthcare providers, enabling them to develop targeted prevention strategies and personalized treatment plans. Ultimately, this project contributes to the broader goal of reducing heart disease-related mortality and improving public health outcomes.
